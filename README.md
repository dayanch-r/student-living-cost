# student-living-cost
This is a result of a public form organized by Dayanch Rejepov about students' living costs in different cities. 
The sole purpose of the form is to give an idea to students about their future study destination. You are free to use the data by giving reference. 
Take your part here and fill one form yourself to support students from Turkmenistan.
Any suggestions and feedback are highly appreciated.
